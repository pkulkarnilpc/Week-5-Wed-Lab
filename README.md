# Lab 7, Part A

## Directions

For the first part of the lab activity, you are going to implement a recursive solution to finding a maximum through the tail method discussed in lecture. The `main` function has already been written for you to run test cases. The output from your function needs to match with the fixed output.

The `findMaxRecTail` function has 3 parameters:

1. `arr` - a constant array containing the elements
2. `SIZE` - a constant integer that holds the number of elements in `arr`
3. `i` - an integer that represents the current position of the "head" of `arr`, with a default value of 0

To continue practicing how to analyze code, you are suggested to perform a time complexity analysis. You can do so as a comment block above the function.
